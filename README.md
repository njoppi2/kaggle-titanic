# ðŸš¢ Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning Competition ðŸŒŠ
This GitHub repository contains some solutions I made to the Kaggle Titanic problem, where the goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic.

# ðŸ“‹ Problem Description:
The Titanic problem is a classic machine learning challenge that involves analyzing various factors of Titanic passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they had family members aboard. The task is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a given passenger survived or not.

# ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure:
data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. The train.csv file includes the labeled data used for model training, while the test.csv file contains the unlabeled data used for predictions.
solutions/: This directory contains the final solution script or notebook that combines all the steps and generates the predictions.
solution*.ipynb: A complete notebook containing code that retrieves data from the .csv files, performs preprocessing, conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), handles missing data, generates new features, utilizes a model for prediction, and presents the final results.

# ðŸ¤– Model and Results:
I'm iteratively generating new solutions to address this problem, with the goal of effectively learning the steps in a machine learning project and testing different approaches.
